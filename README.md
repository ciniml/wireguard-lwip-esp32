# WireGuard Implementation for ESP-IDF

This is an implementation of the [WireGuard&reg;](https://www.wireguard.com/)
for ESP-IDF.

Almost all of this code is based on the
[WireGuard Implementation for lwIP](https://github.com/smartalock/wireguard-lwip),
but some potion of the code is adjusted to build with ESP- to run on ESP32
devices.
